Hello all, welcome to SESUG 2025! Within this repository, you have access to presentation materials for the three talks I'll be giving throughout the event.

# PROC SQL Case Study
Tuesday, 9/23 
12:30PM - 2:00PM

Ready to sharpen your PROC SQL skills? This session guides you through a series of questions that gradually increase in complexity, each designed to highlight new techniques and problem-solving strategies. Along the way, you’ll learn about statement order and useful options, manipulate data with CASE expressions, and discover the power of dictionary tables. We’ll also cover inner joins, noncorrelated subqueries, data-driven macro variables with the INTO clause, summary functions, boolean expressions, and SET operators. Whether you’re new to PROC SQL or looking to expand your toolkit, this session provides practical examples you can apply immediately in your own work.

# Simplifying SAS Viya: Explaining the Compute and CAS Servers, Caslibs, and In-Memory Data
Tuesday, 9/23
3:00PM - 4:00PM

SAS Viya is a modern, cloud-enabled analytics platform designed for high-speed processing and scalability. It’s often described with terms like in-memory and massively parallel processing—but what do these concepts really mean in practice, and how can SAS 9 programmers continue to leverage their existing skills in this new environment?

This paper demystifies SAS Viya by breaking down the core capabilities of its two primary servers, explaining caslibs—what they are, how to use them, and how they compare to traditional SAS libraries—and demonstrating how to load data into memory for optimal performance. Helpful options and considerations when working with data on the CAS Server are also explored. Whether you’re new to Viya or transitioning from SAS 9, you’ll gain a clear, practical understanding of how to work effectively in this modern analytics platform.

# SAS Macro Case Study
Wednesday, 9/24
10:00AM - 11:30AM

Learn SAS macro techniques through a step-by-step case study. Starting with a base program containing PROC SQL and PROC SGPLOT steps, the program is transformed into a macro definition that accepts parameters for flexibility and reuse.

Along the way, learn how to create data-driven macro variables, use DO loops with indirect references to generate multiple PDFs with dynamic filters and titles, validate inputs with conditional processing and leverage autocall macros for reusable automation. %PUT statements are used throughout to verify results and aid in debugging, giving you practical strategies to apply in your own projects.

# About Me

Hi, I'm Carleigh Jo! I'm a Technical Training Consultant at SAS. I began my career delivering SAS courses to customers, and I've loved being part of their learning journeys. That experience sparked my passion for projects, research, and creativity, which led me to transition to Content Development. In this role, I create eLearning and instructor-led training materials for SAS courses. 

I’m especially passionate about making data and the SAS language accessible and actionable- this focus drives my work every day. My expertise lies in programming in SAS 9 and SAS Viya.

Outside the office, you'll usually find me baking, taking art lessons, exploring new restaurants, or traveling. I look forward to meeting you all!
